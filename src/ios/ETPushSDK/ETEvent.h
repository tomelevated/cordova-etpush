/**
 ETEvent is the new form of analytics for the MobilePush SDK, replacing ETStatsUpdate. It is more flexible in that it can return multiple types of events in one pass. As such, things that are related to each other should be sent back together, and things that are not should be sent separately. It is also unique amongst the ETGenericUpdates in that it was designed to be bulk-sent back to ET, and not individually like the rest. 
 
 An ETEvent is comprised of some combination of the following: a Value, or the amount of units that we are currently measuring, zero or many ObjectIds, or the ET encoded IDs for things like messages, fences, etc, and one or many AnalyticTypes, or what analytics are contained in this update. One common use of this is time in app - If a user spends 60 seconds (1 minute) in the app, you would make an ETEvent with a value of 60 and add the analytic type MobilePushStatisticTypeTimeInApp. If you want to add a message ID for an open, add a second analyticType of MobilePushStatisticTypeOpen and add the objectId of the message ID (_m). Easy peasey.
 
 Some of the enum values are marked deprecated, which indicates that they should not be used in the SDK. These enum values are for analytics on the Middle Tier only. Do not use these in ETEvents.
