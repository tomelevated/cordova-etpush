/**
 ETPhoneHome is like a highway management system, governing the sending of data to and from Salesforce, and caching that which can't get sent home. It works by marshalling around GenericUpdate object subclasses, which themselves create a common pattern for handling business.
 
 Data should be sent back using phoneHome:, which will start the process of sending data to ET, and failing that, save it to the database. The behavior is all controlled by methods on the GenericUpdate object.
