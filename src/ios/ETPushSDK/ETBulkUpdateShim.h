/**
 This is an adaptor that allows multiple ETGenericUpdate objects of the same class to be uploaded together. It overrides some of the ETGenericUpdate base methods in favor of a different implementation, and generates a payload differently than a single update would. 
 
 This only works if the ETGenericUpdate follows the convention of havint the tablename (as returned by tableName) match the key in the array payload. For example, the ETEvents tableName is "events", and the payload format is {"events":[...]}.
 
 If everything is working correctly, you can use ETPhoneHome phoneHomeInBulkForGenericUpdateType: and it will take care of the rest for you, which includes marking objects as 'claimed' for sending and deleting them on success. Check the doc on that method (and it's source) for more specifics. There are some extra assumptions on bulk-updatable objects (like the DB being updated to have a claimed column), and they're outlined there.
