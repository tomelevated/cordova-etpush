 ETFenceMessage is a middle class that joins together ETRegions and ETMessages, which exist in a many-to-many relationship with each other.
 
 The SQL of this is set to ON CONFLICT REPLACE, meaning the pair of values will only ever be in there once. 
 
 ETFenceMessages should be passed to ETPhoneHome through saveToDatabaseInstead: only. They shouldn't be sent to phoneHome:.
